This rich text editor is based on two amazing projects [Quill](https://quilljs.com/) and [reac-quill](https://github.com/zenoamaro/react-quill). And it has been used in a real production, [Matters](http://matters.news) a writing platform built on top of IPFS. Currently, we're pulling it out as a standlone package, so there will be some big changes in the following. ðŸ˜Ž
